# **Init**

### The Challenge 
This project, init, is an initiation to system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of
scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis. It is laid out as a series of questions to be answered, separated into 3 sections: Network, Systems, and Scripting. The pdf that containd the questions can be found [here.](https://github.com/finolacahill/init/blob/master/init.en.pdf)

### Learning objectives 
I used Vagrant to explore using my first virtual machine. This project exposed me to a variety of different commands to allow me to navigate my system better, and set down a better basic knowledge base of how a network works. It was an easy introduction to this topic. The most interesting part of this project was definitely the Scriptong section. This allowed me to delve further into bash scripting, and I used the third freelance script to create a fun little fortune teller. 


### Usage
Some answers should be run with the *sh* command, and some should be read with the *cat* command. The accompanying [PDF](https://github.com/finolacahill/init/blob/master/init.en.pdf) clarifies this.
